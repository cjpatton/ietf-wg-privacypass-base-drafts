This document specifies the architectural framework for constructing
secure and anonymity-preserving instantiations of the Privacy Pass
protocol. It provides recommendations on how the protocol ecosystem
should be constructed to ensure the privacy of clients, and the security
of all participating entities.

# Introduction

Privacy Pass is a protocol for authorization based on anonymous-credential
authentication mechanisms. Typical approaches for authorizing clients,
such as through the use of long-term cookies, are not privacy-friendly
since they allow servers to track clients across sessions and interactions.
Privacy Pass takes a different approach: instead of presenting linkable
state carrying information to servers, e.g., whether or not the client
is an authorized user or has completed some prior challenge, clients
present unlinkable proofs that attest to this information.

The most basic Privacy Pass protocol provides a set of cross-origin
authorization tokens that protect the client's anonymity during interactions
with a server. This allows clients to communicate an attestation of a
previously authenticated server action, without having to reauthenticate
manually. The tokens retain anonymity in the sense that the act of
revealing them cannot be linked back to the session where they were
initially issued.

At a high level, Privacy Pass is composed of two protocols: issuance
and redemption.

The issuance protocol runs between a Client and two network functions in the
Privacy Pass architecture: Attestation and Issuance. These two network
functions can be implemented by the same protocol participant, but can also be
implemented separately. The Issuer is responsible for issuing tokens in
response to requests from Clients. The Attester is responsible for attesting
properties about the Client for which tokens are issued. The Issuer needs to be
trusted by the server that later redeems the token. Attestation can be
performed by the Issuer or by an Attester that is trusted by the Issuer.
Clients might prefer to select different Attesters, separate from the Issuer,
to be able to use preferred authentication methods or improve privacy by not
directly communicating with an Issuer. Depending on the attestation,
Attesters can store state about a Client, such as the number of overall tokens
issued thus far. As an example of an Issuance protocol, in the original Privacy
Pass protocol {{PPSRV}}, tokens were only issued to Clients that solved
CAPTCHAs. In this context, the Attester attested that some client solved a
CAPTCHA and the resulting token produced by the Issuer was proof of this fact.

The redemption protocol runs between Client and Origin (server). It allows
Origins to challenge Clients to present one or more tokens for authorization.
Depending on the type of token, e.g., whether or not it is cross-origin
or per-origin, and whether or not it can be cached, the Client either presents
a previously obtained token or invokes the issuance protocol to acquire one
for authorization.

The issuance and redemption protocols operate in concert as shown in
the figure below.

{: #fig-overview title="Privacy Pass Architectural Components"}

This document describes requirements for both issuance and redemption
protocols. This document also describes ecosystem considerations that
impact the stated privacy and security guarantees of the protocol.

# Terminology

{::boilerplate bcp14}

The following terms are used throughout this document.

- Client: An entity that seeks authorization to an Origin.
- Origin: An entity that challenges Clients for tokens.
- Issuer: An entity that issues tokens to Clients for properties
  attested to by the Attester.
- Attester: An entity that attests to properties of Client for the
  purposes of token issuance.

# Architecture

The Privacy Pass architecture consists of four logical entities --
Client, Origin, Issuer, and Attester -- that work in concert as
shown in {{introduction}} for token issuance and redemption. This
section describes the purpose of token issuance and redemption
and the requirements therein on the relevant participants.

## Redemption Protocol

The redemption protocol is a simple challenge-response based authorization
protocol between Client and Origin. Origins prompt Clients with a token
challenge and, if possible, Clients present a valid token for the challenge
in response. The context in which an Origin challenges a Client for a token
is referred to as the redemption context. This context includes all information
associated with the redemption event, such as the timestamp of the event,
Client visible information (including the IP address), and the Origin name.

The challenge controls the type of token that the Origin will accept for the
given resource. As described in {{?HTTP-Authentication=I-D.ietf-privacypass-auth-scheme}},
there are a number of ways in which the token may vary, including:

- Issuance protocol. The token identifies the type of issuance protocol
  required for producing the token. Different issuance protocols have different
  security properties, e.g., some issuance protocols may produce tokens that
  are publicly verifiable, whereas others may not have this property.
- Issuer identity. Tokens identify which Issuers are trusted for a given
  issuance protocol. The selected Issuer transitively determines what types
  of attestation the Origin is willing to accept. For example, if a given Issuer
  `issuer.example` has two trusted Attesters, then any Origin choosing `issuer.example`
  as its Issuer is willing to accept attestation checks done by either of these
  two Attesters.
- Redemption context. Tokens can be bound to a given redemption context, which
  influences a client's ability to pre-fetch and cache tokens. For example,
  an empty redemption context always allows tokens to be issued and redeemed
  non-interactively, whereas a fresh and random redemption context means
  that the redeemed token must be issued only after the client receives the challenge.
  See Section 2.1.1 of {{HTTP-Authentication}} for more details.
- Per-origin or cross-origin. Tokens can be constrained to the Origin for
  which the challenge originated, or can be used across Origins.

Depending on the use case, Origins may need to maintain state to track
redeemed tokens. For example, Origins that accept cross-origin
across shared redemption contexts tokens SHOULD track which tokens
have been redeemed already in those redemption contexts, since these
tokens can be issued and then spent multiple times in response to any
such challenge. See Section 2.1.1 of {{HTTP-Authentication}} for discussion.

Origins that admit cross-origin tokens bear some risk of allowing tokens
issued for one Origin to be spent in an interaction with another Origin.
If tokens protected with resources are unique to a single Origin, then
said Origin MUST NOT admit cross-origin tokens for authorization.

## Issuance Protocol

The issuance protocol embodies the core of Privacy Pass. It takes as input
a challenge from the redemption protocol and produces a token, as shown
in the figure below.

~~~
  Origin          Client        Attester          Issuer

                  +--------------------------------------\
    Challenge ----> TokenRequest --->                    |
                  |             (attest)                 |
                  |                TokenRequest --->     |
                  |                            (evaluate)|
                  |                   <--- TokenResponse |
      Token  <----+ TokenResponse <---                   |
                  |--------------------------------------/
~~~
{: #fig-issuance title="Issuance Overview"}

Clients interact with the Attester and Issuer to produce a token in response to
a challenge. The context in which an Attester vouches for a Client during issuance
is referred to as the attestation context. This context includes all information
associated with the issuance event, such as the timestamp of the event and
Client visible information, including the IP address or other information specific
to the type of attestation done.

Each issuance protocol may be different, e.g., in the number and types of
participants, underlying cryptographic constructions used when issuing tokens,
and even privacy properties.

Clients initiate the Token issuance protocol using the challenge, a randomly
generated nonce, and public key for the Issuer. The Token issuance protocol
itself can be any interactive protocol between Client, Issuer, or other
parties that produces a valid authenticator over the Client's input, subject
to the following security requirements.

1. Unconditional input secrecy. The issuance protocol MUST NOT reveal anything
about the Client's private input, including the challenge and nonce, to the
Attester or Issuer. The issuance protocol can reveal the Issuer public key for
the purposes of determining which private key to use in producing the token.
A result of this property is that the redemption flow is unlinkable
from the issuance flow.
1. One-more forgery security. The issuance protocol MUST NOT allow malicious
Clients or Attesters (acting as Clients) to forge tokens offline or otherwise
without interacting with the Issuer directly.
1. Concurrent security. The issuance protocol MUST be safe to run concurrently
with arbitrarily many Clients.

Each Issuance protocol MUST come with a detailed analysis of the privacy impacts
of the protocol, why these impacts are justified, and guidelines on how to deploy
the protocol to minimize any privacy impacts.

Clients obtain the Issuer public key directly from the Origin using the process
described in {{HTTP-Authentication}}. Clients MAY apply some form of key consistency
check to determine if this public key is consistency and correct for the specified
Issuer. See {{?CONSISTENCY=I-D.wood-key-consistency}} for example mechanisms.
Depending on the deployment, the Attester may be able to assist the Client in applying
these consistency checks across clients.

Depending on the use case, issuance may require some form of Client
anonymization service similar to an IP-hiding proxy so that Issuers cannot
learn information about Clients. This can be provided by an explicit
participant in the issuance protocol, or it can be provided via external means,
e.g., through the use of an IP-hiding proxy service like Tor. In general,
Clients SHOULD minimize or remove identifying information where possible when
invoking the issuance protocol.

Issuers MUST NOT issue tokens for Clients through untrusted Attesters. This is
important because the Attester's role is to vouch for trust in
privacy-sensitive Client information, such as account identifiers or IP address
information, to the Issuer. Tokens produced by an Issuer that admits issuance
for any type of attestation cannot be relied on for any specific property.
See {{attester-role}} for more details.

### Attester Role

Attestation is an important part of the issuance protocol. Attestation is the
process by which an Attester bears witness to, confirms, or authenticates a
Client so as to verify a property about the Client that is required for
Issuance. Examples of attestation properties include, though are not limited
to:

- Capable of solving a CAPTCHA. Clients that solve CAPTCHA challenges can attest
  to this capability for the purpose of being ruled out as a bot or otherwise
  automated Client.
- Client state. Clients can be associated with state and the attester can
  attest to this state. Examples of state include the number of issuance
  protocol invocations, the client's geographic region, and whether the
  client has a valid application-layer account.
- Trusted device. Some Clients run on trusted hardware that are capable of
  producing device-level attestation statements.

Each of these attestation types has different security properties. For example,
attesting to having a valid account is different from attesting to code being
run on trusted hardware. In general, Attesters should accept a limited form of
attestation formats.

Each attestation format also has an impact on the overall system privacy. For
example, the number of users in possession of a single class of trusted devices
might be less than the number of users that can solve CAPTCHAs. Similarly,
requiring a conjunction of attestation types could decrease the overall
anonymity set size. For example, the number of Clients that have solved a
CAPTCHA in the past day, have a valid account, and are running on a trusted
device is lesser than the number of Clients that have solved a CAPTCHA in the
past day. Attesters should not admit attestation types that result in small
anonymity sets.

The trustworthiness of attesters depends on their ability to correctly and
reliably perform attestation during the issuance protocol. However, in practice,
certain types of attestation can vary in value over time, e.g., if the
attestation process is compromised or maliciously automated. These are
considered exceptional events and require configuration changes to address
the underlying cause. For example, if attestation is compromised because
of a zero-day exploit on compliant devices, then the corresponding attestation
format should be untrusted until the exploit is patched. Addressing changes in
attestation quality is therefore a deployment-specific task. In Split Attester and
Issuer deployments (see {{deploy-split}}), Issuers can choose to remove
compromised Attesters from their trusted set until the compromise is patched,
without needing to modify Origin allow-lists.

### Issuer Role

Issuers MUST be uniquely identifiable by all Clients with a consistent
identifier. In a web context, this identifier might be the Issuer host name.
As discussed later in {{privacy}}, ecosystems that admit a large number of
Issuers can lead to privacy concerns for the Clients in the ecosystem.
Therefore, in practice, the number of Issuers should be bounded. The actual
Issuers can be replaced with different Issuers as long as the total never
exceeds these bounds. Moreover, Issuer replacements also have an effect on
client anonymity that is similar to when a key rotation occurs. See {{privacy}}
for more details about maintaining privacy with multiple Issuers.

#### Key Management

To facilitate issuance, the Issuer MUST hold an Issuance key pair at any
given time. The Issuer public key MUST be made available to all Clients in
such a way that key rotations and other updates are publicly visible.
The key material and protocol configuration that an Issuer uses to produce
tokens corresponds to two different pieces of information:

- The issuance protocol in use; and
- The public keys that are active for the Issuer.

The way that the Issuer publishes and maintains this information impacts
the effective privacy of the clients; see {{privacy}} for more details.
The fundamental requirement for key management and discovery is that Issuers
must be unable to target specific clients with unique keys without detection.
There are a number of ways in which this might be implemented:

- Servers use a verifiable, tamper-free registry from which clients discover
  keys. Similar to related mechanisms and protocols such as Certificate
  Transparency {{?RFC6962}}, this may require external auditors or additional
  client behavior to ensure the registry state is consistent for all clients.
- Clients use an anonymity-preserving tool such as Tor to discover keys
  from multiple network vantage points. This is done to ensure consistent
  keys to seemingly different clients.
- Clients embed Issuer keys into software.

As above, specific mechanisms for key management and discovery are out of scope
for this document.

#### Key Rotation

Token issuance associates all issued tokens with a particular choice of
key. If an Issuer issues tokens with many keys, then this may harm the
anonymity of the Client. For example, they would be able to map the
Client's access patterns by inspecting which key each token they possess
has been issued under.

To prevent against this, Issuers MUST only use one private key for
issuing tokens at any given time. Servers MAY use one or more keys for
redemption to allow Issuers for seamless key rotation.

Servers may rotate keys as a means of revoking tokens issued under old
or otherwise expired keys. Alternatively, Issuers may include expiration
information as metadata alongside the token; See {{metadata}} for more
discussion about metadata constraints. Both techniques are equivalent
since they cryptographically bind expiration to individual tokens.
Key rotations should be limited in frequency for similar reasons.

### Metadata {#metadata}

Certain instantiations of the issuance protocol may permit public or private
metadata to be cryptographically bound to a token. As an example, one
trivial way to include public metadata is to assign a unique issuer
public key for each value of metadata, such that N keys yields log2(N)
bits of metadata. The total amount of metadata bits included in a token
is the sum of public and private metadata bits.

Public metadata is that which clients can observe as part of the token
issuance flow. Public metadata can either be transparent or opaque. For
example, transparent public metadata is a value that the client either
generates itself, or the Issuer provides during the issuance flow and
the client can check for correctness. Opaque public metadata is metadata
the client can see but cannot check for correctness. As an example, the
opaque public metadata might be a "fraud detection signal", computed on
behalf of the Issuer, during token issuance. In normal circumstances,
Clients cannot determine if this value is correct or otherwise a tracking
vector.

Private metadata is that which Clients cannot observe as part of the token
issuance flow. Such instantiations may be built on the Private Metadata Bit
construction from Kreuter et al. {{?KLOR20=DOI.10.1007/978-3-030-56784-2_11}}
or the attribute-based VOPRF from Huang et al. {{HIJK21}}.

Metadata may also be arbitrarily long or bounded in length. The amount of
permitted metadata may be determined by application or by the underlying
cryptographic protocol.

### Issuance Protocol Extensibility {#extensions}

The Privacy Pass protocol and ecosystem are both intended to be receptive to
extensions that expand the current set of functionalities through new issuance
protocols. Each issuance protocol SHOULD come with a detailed analysis of the
privacy impacts of the extension, why these impacts are justified, and
guidelines on how to deploy the protocol to minimize any privacy impacts.
Any extension to the Privacy Pass protocol MUST adhere to the guidelines
specified in {{issuer-role}} for managing Issuer public key data.

# Deployment Considerations {#deployment}

Client uses Privacy Pass to separate attestation context and redemption
context. Linking or combining these contexts can reveal sensitive information
about the Client, including their identity or browsing history. Depending on the
deployment model, separating these contexts can take different forms.
The Origin, Attester, and Issuer portrayed in {{fig-overview}} can be instantiated
and deployed in a number of different ways. This section covers some expected
deployment models and their corresponding security and privacy considerations.
The discussion below assumes non-collusion between entities when operated by
separate parties. Mechanisms for enforcing non-collusion are out of scope
for this architecture.

## Shared Origin, Attester, Issuer {#deploy-shared}

In this model, the Origin, Attester, and Issuer are all operated by the same entity,
as shown in the figure below.

~~~
                   +------------------------------------------+
      Client       |  Attester         Issuer         Origin  |
        |          |                                          |

                   +------------------------------------------+
~~~
{: #fig-deploy-shared title="Shared Deployment Model"}

This model represents the initial deployment of Privacy Pass, as described in {{PPSRV}}.
In this model, the Attester, Issuer, and Origin share the attestation and redemption contexts.
As a result, attestation mechanisms that can uniquely identify a Client, e.g., requiring
that Clients authenticate with some type of application-layer account, are not appropriate,
as they could be used to learn or reconstruct a Client's browsing history.

Attestation and redemption context unlinkability requires that these events be separated
over time, e.g., through the use of tokens with an empty redemption context,
or over space, e.g., through the use of an anonymizing proxy when connecting to the Origin.

## Joint Attester and Issuer {#deploy-joint-issuer}

In this model, the Attester and Issuer are operated by the same entity
that is separate from the Origin, as shown in the figure below.

~~~
                                                   +-----------+

~~~
{: #fig-deploy-joint-issuer title="Joint Attester and Issuer Deployment Model"}

This model is useful if an Origin wants to offload attestation and issuance
to a trusted entity. In this model, the Attester and Issuer share attestation
context for the Client, which can be separate from the Origin's redemption context.

For certain types of issuance protocols, this model separates attestation and redemption
contexts. However, Issuance protocols that require the Issuer to learn information about
the Origin, such as that which is described in {{?RATE-LIMITED=I-D.privacypass-rate-limit-tokens}},
are not appropriate since they could link attestation and redemption contexts through the Origin name.

## Joint Origin and Issuer {#deploy-joint-origin}

In this model, the Origin and Issuer are operated by the same entity, separate from
the Attester, as shown in the figure below.

~~~

{: #fig-deploy-joint-origin title="Joint Origin and Issuer Deployment Model"}

This model is useful for Origins that require Client-identifying attestation,
e.g., through the use of application-layer account information, but do not
otherwise want to learn information about individual Clients beyond what is
observed during the token redemption, such as Client IP addresses.

In this model, attestation and redemption contexts are separate. As a result,
any type of attestation is suitable in this model. Moreover, any type of token
challenge is suitable assuming there is more than one Origin involved, since no
single party will have access to the identifying Client information and unique
Origin information. If there is only a single Origin, then per-Origin tokens
are not appropriate in this model, since the Attester can learn the redemption
context. (Note, however, that the Attester does not learn whether a token is
per-Origin or cross-Origin.)

## Split Origin, Attester, Issuer {#deploy-split}

In this model, the Origin, Attester, and Issuer are all operated by different entities,
as shown in the figure below.

{: #fig-deploy-split title="Split Deployment Model"}

This is the most general deployment model, and is necessary for some
types of issuance protocols where the Attester plays a role in token
issuance; see {{RATE-LIMITED}} for one such type of issuance protocol.
In this model, the Attester, Issuer, and Origin have a separate view
of the Client: the Attester sees potentially sensitive Client identifying
information, such as account identifiers or IP addresses, the Issuer
sees only the information necessary for Issuance, and the Origin sees
token challenges, corresponding tokens, and Client source information,
such as their IP address. As a result, attestation and redemption contexts
are separate, and therefore any type of token challenge is suitable in
this model assuming there is more than a single Origin. As in the
Joint Origin and Issuer model in {{deploy-joint-origin}}, if there is
only a single Origin, then per-Origin tokens are not appropriate.

# Privacy Considerations {#privacy}

Client uses Private Pass to separate attestation context and redemption
context. Depending on the deployment model, this can take different forms.
For example, any Client can only remain private relative to the entire
space of other Clients using the protocol. Moreover, by owning tokens for
a given set of keys, the Clients' anonymity set shrinks to the total number
of Clients controlling tokens for the same keys.

In the following, we consider the possible ways that Issuers can leverage
their position to try and reduce the anonymity sets that Clients belong
to (or, user segregation). For each case, we provide mitigations that
the Privacy Pass ecosystem must implement to prevent these actions.

## Metadata Privacy Implications

Any metadata bits of information can be used to further segment the
size of the Client's anonymity set. Any Issuer that wanted to
track a single Client could add a single metadata bit to Client tokens. For
the tracked Client it would set the bit to `1`, and `0` otherwise. Adding
additional bits provides an exponential increase in tracking granularity
similarly to introducing more Issuers (though with more potential
targeting).

For this reason, the amount of metadata used by an Issuer in creating
redemption tokens must be taken into account -- together with the bits
of information that Issuers may learn about Clients otherwise. Since this
metadata may be useful for practical deployments of Privacy Pass, Issuers
must balance this against the reduction in Client privacy. In general,
Issuers should bound the metadata permitted so as to not allow it to uniquely
identify each possible user.

## Issuer Key Rotation

Techniques to introduce Client "segregation" can be used to reduce
Client anonymity. Such techniques are closely linked to the type of key
schedule that is used by the Issuer. When an Issuer rotates their key,
any Client that invokes the issuance protocol in this key cycle will be
part of a group of possible clients owning valid tokens for this key. To
mechanize this attack strategy, an Issuer could introduce a key rotation
policy that forces Clients into small key cycles. Thus, reducing the
size of the anonymity set for these Clients.

Issuers SHOULD invoke key rotation for a period of time between 1 and 12 weeks.
Key rotations represent a trade-off between Client privacy and continued Issuer
security. Therefore, it is still important that key rotations occur on a
regular cycle to reduce the harmfulness of an Issuer key compromise.

With a large number of Clients, a minimum of one week gives a large enough
window for Clients to participate in the issuance protocol and thus enjoy the
anonymity guarantees of being part of a larger group. A maximum of
12 weeks limits the damage caused by a key compromise. If an Issuer
realizes that a key compromise has occurred then the Issuer should
generate a new key and make it available to Clients. If possible, it should
invoke any revocation procedures that may apply for the old key.

## Large Number of Issuers {#servers}

Similarly to the Issuer rotation dynamic that is raised above, if there
are a large number of Issuers, and Origins accept all of them, segregation
can occur. For example, if Clients obtain tokens from many Issuers, and
Origins later challenge a Client for a token from each Issuer, Origins
can learn information about the Client. Each per-Issuer token that a
Client holds essentially corresponds to a bit of information about the
Client that Origin learn. Therefore, there is an exponential loss in
anonymity relative to the number of Issuers that there are.

For example, if there are 32 Issuers, then Origins learn 32 bits of
information about the Client if a valid token is presented for each one.
If the distribution of Issuer trust is anything close to a uniform
distribution, then this is likely to uniquely identify any Client amongst
all other Internet users. Assuming a uniform distribution is clearly the
worst-case scenario, and unlikely to be accurate, but it provides a stark
warning against allowing too many Issuers at any one time.

In cases where clients can hold tokens for all Issuers at any given
time, a strict bound SHOULD be applied to the active number of Issuers
in the ecosystem. We propose that allowing no more than 4 Issuers at any
one time is highly preferable (leading to a maximum of 64 possible user
segregations). However, having a very large user base could potentially
allow for larger values. Issuer replacements should only occur with the same
frequency as config rotations as they can lead to similar losses in
anonymity if clients still hold redemption tokens for previously active
Issuers.

In addition, we RECOMMEND that trusted registries indicate at all times
which Issuers are deemed to be active. If a Client is asked to invoke
any Privacy Pass exchange for an Issuer that is not declared active,
then the client SHOULD refuse to retrieve the Issuer public key
during the protocol.

### Allowing More Issuers {#more-servers}

The bounds on the numbers of Issuers that this document proposes above are
very restrictive. This is because this document considers a situation where
a Client could be challenged (and asked to redeem) tokens for any Issuer.

An alternative system is to ensure a robust strategy for ensuring that
Clients only possess redemption tokens for a similarly small number of
Issuers at any one time. This prevents a malicious verifier from being
able to invoke redemptions for many Issuers since the Client would only
be holding redemption tokens for a small set of Issuers. When a Client
is issued tokens from a new Issuer and already has tokens from the
maximum number of Issuers, it simply deletes the oldest set of
redemption tokens in storage and then stores the newly acquired tokens.

For example, if Clients ensure that they only hold redemption tokens for
4 Issuers, then this increases the potential size of the anonymity sets
that the Client belongs to. However, this doesn't protect Clients
completely as it would if only 4 Issuers were permitted across the whole
system. For example, these 4 Issuers could be different for each Client.
Therefore, the selection of Issuers they possess tokens for is still
revealing. Understanding this trade-off is important in deciding the
effective anonymity of each Client in the system.

#### Redemption Partitions {#redemption-partitions}

Another option to allow a large number of Issuers in the ecosystem,
while preventing the joining of a number of different tokens is for the
Client to maintain sharded "redemption partitions". This would allow the
Client to redeem the tokens it wishes to use in a particular context,
while still allowing the Client to maintain a large variety of tokens
from many Issuers. Within a redemption partition, the Client limits the
number of different Issuers used to a small number to maintain the
privacy properties the Client requires. As long as each redemption
partition maintains a strong privacy boundary with the others, the
number of bits of information the verifier can learn is bounded by the
number of "redemption partitions".

To support this strategy, the client keeps track of a `partition` which
contains the set of Issuers that redemptions have been attempted
against. An empty redemption is returned when the limit has been
hit:

~~~
  Client(partition, issuer)                     Issuer(skS, pkS)
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  if issuer not in partition {
    if partition.length > REDEEM_LIMIT {
      Output {}
      return
    }
    partition.push(issuer)
  }
  token = store[issuer.id].pop()
  req = Redeem(token, info)

                               req
                        ------------------>

                               if (dsIdx.includes(req.data)) {
                                 raise ERR_DOUBLE_SPEND
                               }
                               resp = Verify(pkS, skS, req)
                               if resp.success {
                                 dsIdx.push(req.data)
                               }

                                resp
                        <------------------
  Output resp
~~~

## Centralization

A consequence of limiting the number of participants (Attesters or Issuers)
in Privacy Pass deployments for meaningful privacy is that it forces
concentrated centralization amongst those participants.
{{?CENTRALIZATION=I-D.nottingham-avoiding-internet-centralization}} discusses
several ways in which this might be mitigated. For example, a multi-stakeholder
governance model could be established to determine what participants are
fit to operate as participants in a Privacy Pass deployment. This is precisely
the model used to control the Web's trust model.

Alternatively, Privacy Pass deployments might mitigate this problem through
implementation. For example, rather than centralize the role of attestation
in one or few entities, attestation could be a distributed function performed
by a quorum of many parties, provided that neither Issuers nor Origins learn
which attester implementations were chosen. As a result, clients could have
more opportunities to switch between attestation participants.

# Security Considerations {#security}

Beyond the aforementioned security gaols for the Issuance protocol
({{issuance-protocol}}), it is important for Privacy Pass deployments to
mitigate the risk of abuse by malicious Clients.

## Token Exhaustion

When a Client holds tokens for an Issuer, it is possible for any
verifier to invoke that client to redeem tokens for that Issuer. This
can lead to an attack where a malicious verifier can force a Client to
spend all of their tokens from a given Issuer. To prevent this from
happening, tokens can be scoped to single Origins such that they can only
be redeemed for a single Origin.

If tokens are cross-Origin, Clients should use alternate methods to prevent
many tokens from being redeemed at once. For example, if the Origin requests
an excess of tokens, the Client could choose to not present any tokens for
verification if a redemption had already occurred in a given time window.
